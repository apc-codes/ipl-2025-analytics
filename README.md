# 🏏 IPL 2025 Data Analysis & Visualization Dashboard

A complete data analytics project on IPL 2025 using Python, focusing on team performance, player statistics, and match strategy insights.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes IPL 2025 match and ball-by-ball data to extract and present meaningful insights such as:

- Team performance and win distribution  
- Player rankings (Orange Cap & Purple Cap)  
- Strike rate and economy rate analysis  
- Chasing vs Defending match outcomes  
- Match trends and scoring patterns  

The project also handles **real-world data issues** like missing values, inconsistent column names, and varying dataset formats.
